## Supported Versions

The supported version of kutils is always the newest release, older versions will not recieve any bug fixes.
this means that if kutils migrates to a newer minecraft version, there isn't going to be a supported older version.

Versions containing only a patch or a fix will have a suffix -p1 (p = patch, 1 = the patch number for the version), indicating they are not full releases but only small patches.

| Version    | Supported          |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| latest     | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest   | :x:                |
